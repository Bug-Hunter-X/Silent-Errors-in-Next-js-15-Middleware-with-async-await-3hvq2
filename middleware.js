In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using the `async/await` syntax within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` alongside custom middleware.  If an error happens within the async function, the error might not be properly handled, resulting in a silent failure, or even worse, an unhandled promise rejection that doesn't trigger an error page.  Standard try-catch blocks might not reliably catch these errors in all circumstances, leading to difficult-to-debug issues.
