# Next.js 15 Middleware and Async/Await Silent Errors

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 where errors within `async/await` functions in `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, used in conjunction with middleware, might not be properly handled, leading to silent failures.

## The Problem
The issue lies in the error handling behavior when an asynchronous operation fails within a `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` function, especially when custom middleware is also involved.  Traditional `try...catch` blocks might not always intercept the thrown errors.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the behavior. You may need to trigger the error condition specified in `pages/index.js`

## Solution
The solution involves more robust error handling.  The provided solution file explores some techniques that can address the issue, including enhanced `try...catch` blocks and careful logging.

## Additional Notes
This bug might not manifest consistently across all Next.js versions or environments.  The specific conditions for this silent error to occur may vary and needs further investigation.
